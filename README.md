## My process

### Built with

- HTML with Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS with Flexbox

### What I learned

CSS is the most challenging aspect, given that most examples are provided with limited dimensions. It is necessary to imagine different results and list the similarities and differences.

### Continued development

CSS, as a cornerstone of frontend development, presents an ever-evolving landscape of techniques and best practices. Through continued learning and hands-on projects, I aim to stay abreast of the latest advancements in CSS, ensuring that my abilities align with contemporary design standards.

Additionally, delving into theming not only emphasizes the importance of consistent visual branding but also showcases my commitment to creating cohesive and engaging user interfaces. By refining my theming skills, I strive to imbue projects with a unique and polished look, contributing to a seamless and memorable user experience.

As part of my ongoing journey on Frontend Mentor, this emphasis on CSS and theming serves as a catalyst for my growth as a frontend developer. It reflects my proactive approach to addressing challenges and staying attuned to industry trends, ultimately enriching my ability to deliver visually stunning and functionally robust web solutions.
